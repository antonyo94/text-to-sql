# Text To SQL 

## 🛠 Skills
Python, Chat-GPT API, Generative-AI

## 📝 Requirements
*The project is a POC created for a corporate challenge in which the participants, divided into groups of max 3 people, have the objective of creating and presenting to the public an application proposal based on the use of Generative-AI.*

## 📖 Lessons Learned
Participation in the project allowed me to study the state of the art of **Generative-AI** and in particular the use of **LLMs** in the text-To-Sql field, through the study of the paper Interleaving Pre-Trained Language Models and Large Language Models for Zero-Shot NL2SQL Generation(https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08891). Furthermore, my contribution to the creation of the POC allowed me to learn how to use the **APIs** made available by established models of Generative Artificial Intelligence, such as **Chat-GPT**, and how through the latter, it is possible to provide customers ready-to-use solutions.
