# Text To SQL 

## 🛠 Skills
- Python
- Chat-GPT API
- Generative-AI

## 📝 Requirements
*The project is a POC created for a corporate challenge in which the participants, divided into groups of max 3 people, have the objective of creating and presenting to the public an application proposal based on the use of Generative-AI.*

## 📖 Lessons Learned
- Participation in the project allowed me to:
  - Study the state of the art of **Generative-AI**, particularly focusing on the use of **LLMs** (Large Language Models) in the **Text-to-SQL** field.
  - Study the paper titled "Interleaving Pre-Trained Language Models and Large Language Models for Zero-Shot NL2SQL Generation" ([link to paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08891)).

- My contribution to the creation of the **POC** (Proof of Concept) enabled me to:
  - Learn how to use **APIs** made available by established Generative AI models, such as **Chat-GPT**.
  - Understand how these models can be leveraged to provide customers with ready-to-use solutions.
